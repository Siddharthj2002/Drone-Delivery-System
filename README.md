# Drone-Delivery-System


● Project Description:

  This project is designed for a sample company named DroneDeliv. It is a company that deploys 
  drones to deliver life essentials in a post-apocalypse world, where everyone stays home because 
  of biohazards outside. The drones are assigned to different districts, each with a pre-calculated 
  route to visit all households. In order to provide fast and responsive customer services, the drone 
  will update the route to skip those with no active order.

● Project Goals:

  -> Show ability to write a generic class that implements a particular interface, fulfilling the
  contract it specifies (including Big O() behavior and an Iterable implementation).
  -> Implementing proper use of exceptions.
  -> Gain practice writing recursive methods and List ADT.
  -> Gain practice writing appropriate unit tests.

● Project Background

  The goal is to provide a linear data structure that represents the route, and allows fast updates.
  In this project, we will use a linked-based implementation for the List abstract data type. 
  A singly linked list will act as a drone route.

  ● Code Structure:
  
  This project contains the following important folders:
  
  -> src: This is the source folder which consists of all the important files and code related to this project.
  
  -> src/test: This is the package folder containing all of the public unit tests.
  
  -> lib: This is where you can find libraries that are included with the project. At the very
          least you will find two jar files that are used to run the JUnit test framework.
